  description: |
    With the UPS Delivery Intercept® API, a shipper can cancel or reroute a shipment they have sent, prior to delivery.

    ## Key Business Values
    - Elimination of manually processing customer requests
    - Acceptance of requests later in the delivery process

    ## CIE Behavior

    The Delivery Intercept API will return a stubbed success response if the correct data is used for a given endpoint. The static data that is valid for each of the endpoints is in the table below:

    | Endpoint | transId | trackingNumber                                                                                                                                                                                              |
