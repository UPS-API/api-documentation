    # CIE Behavior

    The Delivery Intercept API will return a stubbed success response if the correct data is used for a given endpoint. The static data that is valid for each of the endpoints is in the table below:
    
    | Endpoint | transId | trackingNumber                                                                                                                                                                                              |
