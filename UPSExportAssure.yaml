    ## Key Features

    ### 1. Basic Description Guidance (Free Feature)

    This feature helps you avoid commonly used, invalid shipment descriptions to avoid hold-ups at customs. For comprehensive description guidance, please refer the Interactive Commodity Description API. Basic Description Guidance includes:

      - Checking your commodity description against commonly used descriptions that typically result in a customs delay.
      - Provide basic guidance for improving an invalid commodity description.

    ### 2. Power of Attorney (POA) Requirements

    Understanding legal permissions is key for obeying international trade laws. This feature:

      - Reviews commodity details for POA requirements.
      - Determines when a POA is needed for customs clearance.
      - Proactively notifies user of POA requirement to help avoid customs delays.

    ### 3. UPS Prohibited Goods Guidance (Free Feature)

    Note that this must be turned on in order to use feature 4, 

      - Reviews commodity details for POA requirements.
      - Note 1: evaluateImportExportRequirements is the name of the endpoint which performs the UPS Prohibited goods check. There is no charge to call this endpoint.
      - Note 2: evaluateImportExportRequirements MUST be set to true in order to use Feature #4


    ### 4. Commodity Compliance Guidance (Premium Feature)

      This premium feature checks for any restrictions or prohibitions for the specific commodity you are shipping (including any forms needed to clear customs) for the country you are shipping to. A chargeable event is when guidance is provided, including that no restrictions and prohibitions are found. Commodity Compliance Guidance requires a full, destination country specific tariff code to provide guidance. If you do not have this for each product in each country you ship to, you can use the Export Assure: Interactive Commodity Description API to determine this. Included in Commodity Compliance Guidance is:
      -	Details on what commodities can be shipped to and from specific locations, including restrictions based on the country of origin of the good.
      -	Information specific to the commodities and origins/destinations.
      -	Notification for international shipping forms needed for the commodity to clear customs.
      -	Note 1: evaluateImportExportRequirements - the free feature for UPS Prohibited Goods - MUST be set to true in order to use Commodity Compliance Guidance
      -	Note 2: advancedImportExportRequirements is the endpoint for Commodity Compliance Guidance, and will incur a charge each time guidance is provided
