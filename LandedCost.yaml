  title: Landed Cost Quote API
  description: |
  
    The Landed Cost Quote API allows you to estimate the all-inclusive cost of international shipments - including applicable duties, VAT, taxes, brokerage fees, and other fees. Required parameters include the currency and shipment details, such as the commodity ID, price, quantity, and country code of origin.

    Key Business Values:
    - **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Get a quick and accurate quote on the landed cost of a shipment, including the cost of goods, transportation, and any other fees associated with getting the goods to their destination.
    - **Operational Efficiency**: Simplify the process of calculating landed costs by eliminating the need to manually research and calculate all of the different fees involved.
    - **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Improve decision-making by having a clear understanding of the total cost of shipping goods before you commit to a purchase..
    - **Optimizing Cash Flow**: Streamline your shipping process by integrating the Landed Cost Quote API into your existing systems.
