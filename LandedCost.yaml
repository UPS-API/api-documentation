  title: Landed Cost Quote API
  description: |
  
    The Landed Cost Quote API allows you to estimate the all-inclusive cost of international shipments - including applicable duties, VAT, taxes, brokerage fees, and other fees. Required parameters include the currency and shipment details, such as the commodity ID, price, quantity, and country code of origin.

    - **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Get a quick and accurate quote on the landed cost of a shipment, including the cost of goods, transportation, and any other fees associated with getting the goods to their destination.
    - **Operational Efficiency**: Simplify the process of calculating landed costs by eliminating the need to manually research and calculate all of the different fees involved.
    - **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Improve decision-making by having a clear understanding of the total cost of shipping goods before you commit to a purchase..
    - **Optimizing Cash Flow**: Streamline your shipping process by integrating the Landed Cost Quote API into your existing systems.
