  description: |
  
    The UPS Customer Onboarding API provides an efficient solution for DAP partners to
     streamline customer integration with UPS services. This comprehensive API performs 
     three important onboarding operations — **Account Creation** and **User Registration**
      — each operation designed to improve the user experience and onboarding process.
        
    #### Open Account Service

    - **Purpose**: Supports the creation of new UPS user accounts.

    - **Functionality**: Collects user information, validates addresses, and generates 
    a unique UPS shipper account number. Ensures accurate account setup and record 
    creation

    - **Benefits**: Simplified account creation, improved address accuracy, and 
    streamlined integration with UPS systems
        
    #### User Registration Service

    - **Purpose**: Enables the creation and management of My UPS profiles on behalf 
    of customers, providing access to UPS shipping systems

    - **Functionality**: Supports various user profile scenarios, including creation 
    without a UPS account, creation with a new or existing UPS account, and account 
    authentication

    - **Benefits**: Easy profile management, enhanced security through authentication, 
    and a united solution for managing UPS accounts
        
       
    #### Key Features

    - Consolidated API supporting multiple onboarding operations

    - Streamlined user and account management

    - Address validation for accurate and efficient user registration
